= Launch-Soon

Launch Soon is a drop-in PHP framework that provides a viral launching soon page to collect users before the actual launch date.


=== Pre-requisites

* You need your own mysql database to be online and functional
- This database must have a table name 'interested', with fields 'id', 'email' (varchar(1000)?), 'hash' (varchar(8)?), and 'invites' (int(20)?) with the 'hash' field set as unique
* The site is currently configured to use Google Analytics, so at the moment that's required
* The site currently links out to Twitter, so at the moment a Twitter account for the site is required


=== Configuration

All configuration is done in the config.php file.


=== More

This is a VERY early release, so there's still a lot of fixes, customization & design that hasn't been added in yet.
This README will be updated alongside the framework itself.
