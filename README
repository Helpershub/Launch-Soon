= Launch-Soon

Launch Soon is a drop-in PHP site that provides a viral launching soon page to collect users before your actual launch date.

The site is fairly standard in that it's collecting email addresses, but it also provides a unique URL to each user which keeps track of how many people they get to sign up.

This is an early release, so there's still a lot of customization that hasn't been added in yet.


=== Pre-requisites

* You need your own mysql database to be online and functional with the following characteristics:
- Table name 'interested'
- Field 'id' (auto-increment)
- Field 'email' (varchar(1000)?)
- Field 'hash' (varchar(8)?)
- Field 'invites' (int(20)?)
- The 'hash' field must be set as unique
* A Google Analytics Web Property ID (UA-#######-##) is required because Launch-Soon is currently hard-coded to use Google Analytics
* A Twitter account is require because Launch-Soon is currently hard-coded to link out to Twitter & provides custom Tweet sharing


=== Configuration

All configuration is done in the config.php file.  You are not required to touch any other files.
