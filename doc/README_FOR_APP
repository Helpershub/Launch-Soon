Launch-Soon
===========

Launch Soon is a rails site that provides a viral launching soon page to collect users before your actual launch date.

You can deploy to Heroku, and immediately begin collecting email addresses in your Mailchimp list. It also provides a unique URL to each user, which keeps track of how many people they get to sign up. The referral count is also stored in your Mailchimp list.


Pre-requisites
--------------

* A Mailchimp account with a list named "Interested"
* A Google Analytics Web Property ID (UA-#######-##) is required because Launch-Soon is currently hard-coded to use Google Analytics
* A Twitter account

All configuration is done in the `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file.  You are not required to touch any other files.
